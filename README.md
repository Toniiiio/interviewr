[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/interviewr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=interviewr)


# interviewr: An online coding test for data science.

Test your candidates in R, Python, C++, SQL, Javascript,...

Time is a limiting factor at work. So we canÂ´t give all the candidates a proper chance to demonstrate
their coding and data science skills in an interview.

`interviewr` automizes the process, like other online coding tests. But it is open source and free to use for everyone!

`devtools::install_github('Toniiiio/interviewr')`
